# Property Manager App

This is a basic app built on the Rails Framework (RoR) that allows landlords to keep track of the properties that they own and the tenants that live within each respective property.

Additionally, there exists functionality that renders requests in JSON and uses JS and jQuery to append objects to the DOM to give the app a more interactive and modern feel.

In order to use the app, run the follow commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisPhilbin/propertymanager.git
rails s
```

The above will glone the most recent repo from Github and will start the rails server.  You can then fire up your choice of browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to view the site.
